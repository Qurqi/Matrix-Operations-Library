Hi there!

Thanks for checking out my project.

This is a short project I decided to do before I undertake making a machine learning model from scratch, and a DC circuit solver. I thought it wise to freshen up on my linear algebra knowledge, considering its large role in machine learning and circuit analysis.

My current plan for this library is to use it as practice for other programming projects rather than focus on maximising the efficiency of my algorithms. Algorithm optmization is not my interest here. However, that is not to say that I will exclude any current improvements in, for example, matrix multiplication algorithms for the sake of writing "my own library". In the future I will certainly work on optimizing the library, based on cutting edge algorithms, but the current main-objective is to practice fundamental programming skills.

All the code written here, as an experienced programmer will likely notice, was written by me from scratch. In the process of writing the library I have referenced: Problem solving with C++, 10th edition by W. Savitch and Linear Algebra and Its Applications, 6th edition by David C. Lay, Steven R. Lay, and Judi J. Mcdonald.

I chose these because they were the textbooks I used in my first year of University.

If you have any suggestions about what I might do to improve the library please feel free to email me your ideas.
