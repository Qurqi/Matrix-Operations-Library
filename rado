The most time consuming portion of the Quadcopter drone project was learning how to
calculate the lift the propellers would generate base on the motorsâ€™ torque, and propellers
pitch angle. This was necessary to determine weight restrictions. It may seem out of place to
mention a mechanical design challenge, but I think it demonstrates my ability to overcome
unfamiliar challenges. Within the project I also configured an accelerometer and wireless
communication chip for the onboard Arduino, along with wiring the motors, and motor
controllers.

The Line Following robot project involved a lot of C++ programming on an Arduino board
and designing the logic to drive the robots line-response system. The robots line-response
system involved configuring an array of 5 IR-sensors, tuning their potentiometers, then using
their inputs to inform the motors how to respond to the line.

Thank you for providing the opportunity to work at CSIS, and reviewing my application.
